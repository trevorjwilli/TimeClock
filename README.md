# TimeClock

Timeclock is a shiny app built using Python that is meant to keep track of time through the use of "clock-in" and "clock-out" buttons.
The app keeps track of the time between pushing the "clock-in" button and the "clock-out" button as well as the total time between
successive pushes. Once done for the day, you can push the "reset" button to write the information to a time log csv file.
